    "It was expected to have normally distributed histograms for scores. However, above histograms are in bimodal shape suggesting that two distinct populations are present in the dataset. The inverse correlation of scores and participation rates also helped with understanding of what is going on. Separating the states based on whether the SAT test is mandatory or not, matched very well with high participation rates and low participation rates. This separation indicates that in states where the test is mandatory the participation rates are higher. However, since all students take the test the average scores are lower. In states where the test is not mandatory the participation rates are lower but because only high achiever and motivated students take the test to have the option to go to the best colleges anywhere in US, the scores are higher."
