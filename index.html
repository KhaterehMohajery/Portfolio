                        <h2> Introduction </h2>
                        <p> Behavioral Economics believe in importance of emotions in human decision making process and subsequently its influence on market through investors and social mood. In recent years, variety of methods have been investigated to compute indicators of the publicâ€™s sentiment and mood state from large-scale online data instead of traditional surveys.One of the online data sources is news media content that has been shown to be an important factor shaping investor sentiment. In this project, the relation between news headline and market was investigated to explore the possibility of predicting market trends from news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.<p>
                        <h2> Data </h2>
                        <p> Three measures were selected as market indicators including Dow Jones Industrial Average  (DJIA), the S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) and gold price. The data for these indicators was collected from Yahoo Finance website and <a href="http://www.gold.org/">gold.org</a> website for the years of 2008 to 2016. Two news headline datasets were employed in this test. The archive of New York Times website was scraped to collect the top business news headlines for each day from January 2016 to January 2017. More comprehensive dataset was downloaded from kaggle which included top 25 business headlines from reddit which was a collection of variety of sources from 2008 to 2016.</p>
                        <h2> Methods and Results </h2>
                        <p> Very weak correlation between the negative news sentiment score and market indicators was found. However, the sign of the correlations are in correct direction meaning that increased negativity score resulted in higher gold price and volatility index and lower DJ score all indicating negative trends in financial markets. The volatility index (VIX) showed highest correlation among market indicators and therefore used for predictions.<p>
                        <p> The other approach was to turn this problem to a classification problem. Each day that had a closing index higher than or equal to the opening index classified as a positive day (labeled as class 1). For those days with lower closing index, the day labeled as class zero. In this approach, all the words in news headlines for that day were used for the classification.<p>
                        <p> Using the headlines from the previous day in addition to the same day news headlines along with including two-word phrases increased the accuracy of the random forest classification model to 0.69 (from baseline accuracy of 0.53).<p>

                        <p>   Wordcloud of most frequent words in news headlines.<p>
                        <h2> Introduction </h2>
                        <p> West Nile virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitoes.
Traps has been set by Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) across the city of Chicago to capture mosquitoes and then tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.
Given weather, location and spraying data, this competition asked to predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus. This will help the City of Chicago to more effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.<p>
                        <h2> Data and Methods</h2>
                        <p> Training dataset included the location, dates, species, number of mosquitoes and the presence of virus for each trap for years of 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013.
The test dataset included above information for years 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 except for the type of mosquitoes found in traps. The spraying data was not provided for the test dataset and therefore could not be used as a predictor.
The weather conditions were averaged over 30 days and along with trap locations, dates and number of mosquitoes in traps were used as predictors in several classifying models (random forest, KNN, logistic regression and gradient boosting). For each model, best parameters were chosen using grid search. Due to inbalance classes (having a lot more incidences of 0 with no presence of the virus compared to 1), AUC metric was used as the classifier score.<p>
                        <h2> Results </h2>
                        <p> Stacking the results of two best classifying models of Gradient boosting and KNN gave the highest score of 0.95 on training set and 0.77376 on the submitted test set showing the trap being the most important predicting feature. Also, weather conditions such as Dew Point turned out to be important features.<p>

                        <p> Submitting the probabilities for the test dataset resulted in score of 0.77376. This ranked our group at 324 on Kaggle competition board which is among the top 20% of the competitors.<p>
